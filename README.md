**HasMerch** is a customizable online storefront platform built to give creators, brands, and small businesses their own dedicated merch shop.  
Each store runs under a clean, branded subdomain (e.g., `yourname.hasmerch.com`) and features a styled catalog, dynamic pricing charts, and a checkout powered by Snipcart.  

HasMerch combines modern design, brand customization, and a seamless shopping experience in one platform.
